# Mechanism

Numbers are stored via the <code>Olympus</code> class, being represented in the slow-growing hierarchy out of the intermediate <code>Ordinal</code> class. Namely, an ordinal is represented in its Buchholz normal form, and g_a(n) is represented as [a,n]. Both classes comes with arithmetic, comparison, etc.
